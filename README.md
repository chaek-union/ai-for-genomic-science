## About This Book

This textbook introduces how artificial intelligence is revolutionizing biological research — from analyzing genetic variants to modeling entire cells. It is designed specifically for undergraduate biology students (senior level) who want to understand the computational approaches that are transforming genomics, without requiring prior experience in AI or advanced programming.

The field of genomics has been rapidly transformed by machine learning, deep learning, and large-scale computational methods. These advances now allow us to analyze massive genomic datasets, predict functional impacts of variants, and model complex biological systems with unprecedented accuracy. This textbook takes a biology-first approach to cover the essential AI concepts and methods that undergraduate students need to master, integrating computational techniques with genomic applications.

This book is written for **biology majors** who have a solid foundation in molecular biology and genetics, are curious about computational approaches, want to understand the **why** and **how** behind AI methods in genomics, and are comfortable with basic mathematics. Rather than assuming extensive programming background, we start from the basics and build up gradually, emphasizing conceptual understanding alongside practical applications.

**Please note that chapters are currently being written and improved. The complete version is expected to be finished by 2026!**

## What Makes This Book Different?

### 🧬 Biology-First Approach
Each chapter starts with a **real biological challenge**—experimental limitations that motivate computational solutions. You'll never wonder "why do I need to learn this?"

### 💻 Hands-On Coding Labs
Every chapter includes **Google Colab-based coding exercises**. No installation needed—just click and start learning! All code is heavily commented and designed for beginners.

### 🎯 Clear Mathematical Explanations
Math concepts are explained in **Math Boxes** with biological examples. We won't shy away from equations, but we'll make sure you understand what they mean.

### 📚 Real Case Studies
Learn from actual research papers and real datasets. See how these methods are being used to make biological discoveries right now.
